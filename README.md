Hello I'm S.Allwin Zola, this project right here is a simple responsive ReactJS and MongoDB web application that allows users to perform a daily mental health check-in.

1.Front-end Development : This was built primarily using ReactJS and bootstrap for styling.
    i. Responsive across devices with different screen sizes.
   ii. There are totally 4 components:
          • MenNavbar.js
          • MenLogin.js
          • Dashboard.js
          • CheckInForm.js

2. Back-end Development : I have used MongoDB as Database and axios for API handling.
    i. Backend code was written using NodeJS.
   ii. ExpressJS - a framework of NodeJS.
  iii. RESTful API to :
          • create an user
          • login a user
          • create a checkin
          • getById/getAll checkin for a particular user
   iv. JWT to encrypt password for security purposes.
